# Community Content - Azure Functions

This folder contains content introducing Azure Functions and demonstrating how to use them to write code that runs in the cloud. The content is divided into two sessions:

- Session 1 - Slides
- Session 2 - Azure Functions (HOL)

The HOL may be presented as a hands-on lab or as a demo accompanying the slide deck.
